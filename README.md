# Individual Project 1

## Front-end Web Development with a Professional Profile Website on github.io cloud service

## Overview

For this individual project, I developed a Professional Profile Website and deployed it on `github.io` cloud service. The website serves as a platform to showcase my professional background, skills, and experiences to potential employers. Throughout the project, I focused on meeting both the general, non-technical, and technical requirements outlined in the project specifications.

### Website URL and GitHub Repository

- **Website URL**: [https://okaiso-uc.github.io](https://okaiso-uc.github.io)
- **GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/okaiso-uc/okaiso-uc.github.io.git](https://github.com/okaiso-uc/okaiso-uc.github.io.git)

## General Requirements

I successfully created and deployed a personal website on GitHub cloud (`github.io`). The website includes essential components such as my name, a professional headshot, contact information, educational background, work experiences, and skills. Additionally, I created a new HTML page to introduce the "Web Application Programming and Hacking" course and related hands-on projects, providing comprehensive information about the course and its objectives.

## Non-technical Requirements

To meet the non-technical requirements, I utilized the Bootstrap CSS framework to enhance the styling and layout of my website. This framework allowed me to create a visually appealing and professional-looking website layout while ensuring responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes. Furthermore, I included a page tracker feature to monitor visitor activity on my website, providing insights into user engagement and behavior.

## Technical Requirements

### Basic JavaScript Code

I implemented basic JavaScript functionalities using jQuery and other open-source JavaScript frameworks/libraries. This included:

- Creation of a digital clock and an analog clock to display real-time time information, providing visitors with an interactive and dynamic experience.
  
- Implementation of functionality to show/hide my email address upon user interaction, enhancing user privacy and control over personal information.
  
- Integration of additional JavaScript functionality of my choice, such as a global cyber threat meter, which dynamically updates to reflect the current threat level, providing valuable insights into cybersecurity trends and risks.

### Web APIs Integration

I integrated two public Web APIs to enrich the content of my website:
1. I integrated the jokeAPI to display a new joke on the webpage every 1 minute, enhancing user engagement and entertainment value.
2. I integrated the Weatherbit API to display real-time weather information on the webpage, offering visitors instant access to weather forecasts and conditions, improving the overall user experience and utility of the website.

### JavaScript Cookies

To enhance user experience and personalize interactions, I utilized JavaScript cookies to remember the client's last visit to the website. Depending on whether it was the first visit or a returning visit, a personalized message was displayed to the user, creating a more welcoming and user-friendly environment.

## Conclusion

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in front-end web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By deploying a professional profile website on `github.io`, I showcased my skills and expertise to potential employers. This project not only improved my technical abilities but also provided practical application of the concepts learned in the course. Overall, it was a rewarding experience that significantly contributed to my growth as a web developer.
