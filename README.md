## Overview

For this individual project, I developed a Professional Profile Website and deployed it on `github.io` cloud service. The website serves as a platform to showcase my professional background, skills, and experiences to potential employers. Throughout the project, I focused on meeting both the general, non-technical, and technical requirements outlined in the project specifications.

### Website URL and GitHub Repository

## General Requirements

I successfully created and deployed a personal website on GitHub cloud (`github.io`). The website includes essential components such as my name, a professional headshot, contact information, educational background, work experiences, and skills. Additionally, I created a link to a new HTML page introducing the "Web Application Programming and Hacking" course and related hands-on projects.

## Non-technical Requirements

To meet the non-technical requirements, I utilized an open-source CSS framework, Bootstrap, to enhance the styling and layout of my website. I also included a page tracker to monitor visitor activity on my website.

## Technical Requirements

### Basic JavaScript Code

I implemented basic JavaScript functionalities using jQuery and other open-source JavaScript frameworks/libraries. This included:
- Creation of a digital clock and an analog clock to display real-time time information.
- Implementation of functionality to show/hide my email address upon user interaction.
- Integration of additional JavaScript functionality of my choice to enhance user experience.

### Web APIs Integration

I integrated two public Web APIs to enrich the content of my website:
1. I integrated the jokeAPI to display a new joke on the webpage every 1 minute. This added an element of humor and engagement to the website.
2. I integrated a public API with graphics to display weather information on the webpage. This provided visitors with real-time weather updates directly on the website.

### JavaScript Cookies

To enhance user experience and personalize interactions, I utilized JavaScript cookies to remember the client's last visit to the website. Depending on whether it was the first visit or a returning visit, a personalized message was displayed to the user.

## Conclusion

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in front-end web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By deploying a professional profile website on `github.io`, I showcased my skills and expertise to potential employers. This project not only improved my technical abilities but also provided practical application of the concepts learned in the course. Overall, it was a rewarding experience that significantly contributed to my growth as a web developer.
